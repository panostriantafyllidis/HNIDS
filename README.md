# Signature-Based Intrusion Detection System with Python 

This project aims to develop a Signature-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tailored for Internet of Things (IoT) environments using Python. The IDS detects malicious activities in IoT networks by comparing network traffic patterns against known attack signatures.

## Overview

In IoT environments, ensuring the security of connected devices and networks is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Signature-based IDSs are effective in identifying known attacks by matching patterns in network traffic with pre-defined attack signatures.

## Features

- Signature-based detection of known attacks in IoT network traffic.
- Preprocessing of IoT network data for effective intrusion detection.
- Training and evaluation scripts to assess the performance of the IDS.
- Visualization of detection results and performance metrics.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd signature-based-ids-python-iot

3. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Prepare your IoT network traffic dataset in CSV format and place it in the `data/` directory.

2. Train the intrusion detection model using the provided dataset:
python train.py --dataset data/dataset.csv

3. Test the trained model on a separate test dataset:
python test.py --model trained_model.pth --test_dataset data/test_dataset.csv

4. Visualize the detection results and performance metrics:
python visualization.py --results results.csv
